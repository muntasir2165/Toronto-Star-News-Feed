# Toronto-Star-News-Feed
A Nodejs web app that scrapes Toronto Star (https://www.thestar.com/) and displays summaries of published news articles for the user to review and comment on

## Project Motivation

This app was developed as part of the full stack MongoDB homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. The implemenation involves usage of MongoDB for data persistance, Mongoose ODM, Node.js and Express.js for server-side code and middleware logic handling, and Handlebars for HTML templating.
